# Reconciliation Visualizer for [Empress package](https://github.com/ssantichaivekin/eMPRess)

This sub-package of Empress was developed by Justin Jiang and Trenton Wesley during the summer of 2020 for their research with Professors Ran Libeskind-Hadas and Jessica Wu.

The purpose of this subpackage is to visualize reconciliations of a parasite/host mapping, which is used by biologists to study coevolution. An example of what our code does is below: ![Recon Image](https://github.com/justinjiang1212/vistrans/blob/master/images/Figure_1.png)



We used this repository to develop this subpackage independently of the main Empress development; thus, this repository lacks branches, pull requests, and other indicators of an active software development project.  

The code in this repository was eventually subsumed into the main Empress development repository, with this [pull request](https://github.com/ssantichaivekin/empress/pull/134). The main Empress package is linked in the header of this file. A description of the main project can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/empress/home) and a paper has been submitted.
